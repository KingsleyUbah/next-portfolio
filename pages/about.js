            <p> My name is Kingsley Ubah. I am 22 years old web developer from Nigeria. I am particularly interested in technical writing. When I am not coding or writing, I read my favorite books and play some cool video games. I am a huge fan of good movies
            and football. Also, don't play with my food!</p>
            <p>I am skilled in front-end web developent. I am equally good at the back-end. Technologies I work well with includes React, Node JS, Vue, Next,
            Gatsby, OAuth, MongoDB, MySQL and many others. </p>
			<p>I could keep going on and on about my life but I can guarantee that you will be bored in the end. So I'll just end it right here</p>
